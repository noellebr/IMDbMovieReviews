# IMDbMovieReviews
A project that applies Natural Lanugage Processing techniques to identify topic and sentiment clusters of over 100 movie reviews scraped from IMDb. This project was created for MSDS 7337: Natural Language Processing by Noelle Brown.

#### Findings:  
The sentiment clusters do not seem to have distinct patterns based on the sentiment scores obtained from each. Each cluster has positive and negative scores along with similar mean and median scores. It appears as though the reviews are not clustering based on words that have strong sentiment meanings.
